To achieve the tasks you've described, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a virtual environment named "ex00" with Python 3.8:
   ```
   python3 -m venv ex00
   ```

2. Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac):
   ```
   source ex00/bin/activate
   ```

   On Windows:
   ```
   .\ex00\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install the required packages (numpy, jupyter) within the virtual environment:
   ```
   pip3 install -U pip
   pip3 install -U setuptools
   pip3 install numpy jupyter
   ```

4. Create a `requirements.txt` file containing the installed packages:
   ```
   pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
   ```

5. Launch JupyterLab on port 8891 and create a notebook named "Notebook_ex00":
   ```
   jupyter lab --port 8891
   ```

6. In JupyterLab, create a new notebook and add the desired text in the cells as you described.

Here's how you can structure the notebook:

Cell 1 (Markdown cell):
```markdown
# H1 TITLE
## H2 TITLE
```

Cell 2 (Code cell):
```python
print("Buy the dip ?")
```

Remember to save your notebook periodically. You can use the JupyterLab interface to do so.

It's generally recommended to **ignore** the `env` folder (or any virtual environment folder) when using version control systems like Git. The virtual environment contains dependencies and configuration specific to your project, and it's not necessary to include it in your version control repository. Instead, you should include a `requirements.txt` file, which lists the project's dependencies.

To ignore the `env` folder in Git, you can create or modify a `.gitignore` file in your project directory and add the following line to it:

```
env/
```

This tells Git to ignore the `env` directory and not include it when you commit changes. Including the `requirements.txt` file allows others to recreate the virtual environment with the same dependencies using `pip`.

To recreate the virtual environment on a different system, someone can use the following command after cloning the repository and navigating to the project directory:

```bash
python -m venv env  # Create a new virtual environment
source env/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
# Or on Windows: .\env\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt  # Install project dependencies
```

This way, you separate your project's code from its dependencies, making it easier to collaborate and maintain your codebase.
