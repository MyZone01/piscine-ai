    "# Exercise 3: Slicing\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this exercise is to learn NumPy indexing/slicing. It allows to access values of the NumPy array efficiently and without a for loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a NumPy array of dimension 1 that contains all integers from 1 to 100 ordered.\n",
    "2. Without using a for loop and using the array created in Q1, create an array that contain all odd integers. The expected output is: `np.array([1,3,...,99])`. _Hint_: it takes one line\n",
    "3. Without using a for loop and using the array created in Q1, create an array that contain all even integers reversed. The expected output is: `np.array([100,98,...,2])`. _Hint_: it takes one line\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Using array of Q1, set the value of every 3 elements of the list (starting with the second) to 0. The expected output is: `np.array([[1,0,3,4,0,...,0,99,100]])`"

    "Slicing in Python is a way to extract a portion of a sequence (like a list, tuple, or string) or any iterable object. It allows you to access a contiguous subsequence or a specific set of elements from the original sequence. Slicing is widely used in Python and is a fundamental concept when working with sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how slicing works in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Syntax**: The general syntax for slicing is `sequence[start:stop:step]`, where:\n",
    "   - `sequence`: The sequence you want to slice (e.g., a list, tuple, string, or NumPy array).\n",
    "   - `start`: The index at which the slicing begins (inclusive).\n",
    "   - `stop`: The index at which the slicing ends (exclusive).\n",
    "   - `step` (optional): The step size or the interval between elements to include in the slice.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Start, Stop, and Step**:\n",
    "   - `start`: If not specified, it defaults to 0 (the beginning of the sequence).\n",
    "   - `stop`: If not specified, it defaults to the end of the sequence.\n",
    "   - `step`: If not specified, it defaults to 1 (i.e., every element is included).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Indexing**: Slicing uses zero-based indexing, which means the first element has an index of 0, the second element has an index of 1, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Result**: The result of slicing is a new sequence containing the elements from the original sequence as specified by the `start`, `stop`, and `step` parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `my_list[1:4]`: This slices `my_list` from index 1 (inclusive) to 4 (exclusive), so it includes elements at indices 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "- `my_string[::2]`: This slices `my_string` with a step of 2, which means it selects every second character from the string.\n",
    "- `my_tuple[:3]`: This slices `my_tuple` from the beginning up to index 3 (exclusive), including elements at indices 0, 1, and 2.\n",
    "- `my_list[::-1]`: This slices `my_list` with a step of -1, which reverses the order of elements in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing is a powerful tool for working with sequences in Python, allowing you to efficiently extract and manipulate data without the need for explicit loops."
